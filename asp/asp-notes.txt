Differrence between ASP.net and .net core:
ASP.net is a web framework for building web applications using C# and HTML. It is a part of the .NET Framework and is used to build dynamic web applications. It is a server-side technology that runs on the IIS web server.
.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, and microservice-based applications. It is a part of the .NET Foundation and is used to build .NET applications.
It is a client-side technology that runs on the .NET runtime. 
Advantages of .net core:
1.Faster performance: ASP.NET Core (built on .NET Core/.NET 5+) is faster than ASP.NET (built on the .NET Framework) due to architectural optimizations like a lightweight middleware pipeline, reduced overhead, and performance-focused libraries like System.Text.Json.

2.Improved performance for modern workloads: ASP.NET Core is optimized for cloud-native and microservice architectures, with features like in-process hosting, async support, and integration with Docker/Kubernetes, making it more efficient than traditional ASP.NET.

3.Enhanced security: ASP.NET Core benefits from modern security practices, including automatic security updates via NuGet, built-in HTTPS enforcement, and improved dependency management. Cross-platform compatibility also reduces risks tied to legacy Windows-specific vulnerabilities.

4.Better scalability: ASP.NET Core’s lightweight, modular design allows horizontal scaling and stateless architectures, making it ideal for distributed systems. Features like WebSocket support and gRPC integration outperform ASP.NET’s monolithic approach.

5.Modern developer experience: ASP.NET Core offers cross-platform development (Windows, macOS, Linux), a streamlined CLI, and integration with tools like Visual Studio Code. Features like dependency injection and Razor Pages simplify coding compared to ASP.NET.

6.Advanced tooling: ASP.NET Core includes modern tools like Hot Reload, Docker integration, and cloud-native debugging. The SDK and runtime updates are more frequent and lightweight compared to ASP.NET’s older toolchain.

7.Active support and updates: ASP.NET Core (part of .NET 5/6/7+) receives regular updates and long-term support, whereas legacy ASP.NET on .NET Framework is in maintenance mode with limited future development.

Panel
------
Panel is a tool in webform to group multiple controls together and provide a single interface for the user to interact with. It is used to create a more organized and intuitive user interface. Panels can be nested to create complex layouts and provide a better user experience. Panels can be added to a webform using the panel designer or programmatically using the Panel class.

DropDownList
-------------
DropDownList is a control in webform that allows the user to select a value from a list of options. It is used to provide a list of choices to the user and to restrict the user to select only one option. The DropDownList control can be added to a webform using the dropdownlist designer or programmatically using the DropDownList class.
If you need to catch the event when the dropdownlist is changed, you can use the SelectedIndexChanged event.You can automatically create a function if you doubleclick on the dropdownlist in the designer.
Inside the dropdownlist you can add items using the ListItem class. You can set the text and value of the item.
It should be a dictionary with key and value pairs.
If you want to perform this type of operation you must set the AutoPostBack property to true.
