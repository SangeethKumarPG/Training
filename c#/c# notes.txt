Comments
--------
// - single line Comments
/* */ - multiline Comments.

Variables
---------
Commonly used datatypes are 
int
double 
char : to store single character. If you need to store more than one character you need to specify the size.
string : used to store strings.
bool

typename Variable = value;

Constants
---------
const keyword is used to create constant. The Variables defined with const cannot be changed.
const variableName = value;

C# is case sensitive.
- variable names can have letters, digits and underscore
- Names must begin with a letter or an underscore.
- variable names are often started with small letters. if there are more than one word the first letter of the second word is capitalized.

int - 4 bytes
long - 8 bytes
float -4 bytes
char - 2bytes per character
string - 2 bytes per character.

Type casting
------------
Implicit casting : Automatic conversion from lower sized type to higher sized type (eg: from float to double).
Explicit casting : Manual casting to supported type.
    Convert class is used for this. 
    Convert.ToString(), Convert.ToInt32(), Convert.ToInt64();

To get user input we use:
-------------------------
Console.ReadLine(); - function. The accepted value should be converted to the required type. By default string is accepted.

Operators
---------
Arithematic
Logical
Relational

If you want to find the length of a string we can use .length property.
.ToUpper()
.ToLower()
For converting to lower and upper case.

+ is used to concatenate strings.
string.Concat(firstString, secondString) is a function used for concatenating two strings.

SubString is used to extract a substring from a string.
string.Substring(startIndex, length) is a function used for extracting substring from a string.

indexOf is used to find the index of a character in a string.
string.IndexOf(char) is a function used for finding the index of a character in a string.

\ is used to escape special characters in a string.
\' single quote escape character
\\ backslash escape character
\" double quote escape character
\n new line character
\t tab character
\b backspace character
\r carriage return character

Conditional Statements
----------------------
if-else
switch-case

Loops
-----
for
while
do-while
foreach (used to iterate over a collection)
foreach(type variable in collection){}
